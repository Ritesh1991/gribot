# Gribot

Gribot is an agricultural robot mower that can cut grass in crops such as trees, grapes, etc. However,
Gribot is not only limited to agriculture: it can be used in every area where grass has to be periodically cut, such as 
roadsides, industrial areas, etc.

We are developpin more that just a mower: we are creating a platform that can carry many tools: in a frist step, we do focus on
grass cutting.


The project web site is www.gribot.org.

# Why gribot ?

Maintenance of grass in agricultural crops such as vines or fruit trees, road and motorway borders,
industrial zones, etc. Is mainly done with mowers, brush cutters, tractors and weed killers. Not only
are these operations time-consuming and costly, but they also generate a lot of CO2 and use pollutants.
That's why we want to automate these operations with an intelligent robot that can cut grass as close
to crops, trees, walls, etc. as possible, using GPS location, among other things, to avoid installing a
wire of delimitation.

We want to accelerate the transition to sustainable development, which is why we distribute all the
plans and software of our robot under GNU General Public License (GPL), except for ready-made
items such as motors, GPS modules, LIDAR , etc. Which are under the manufacturer's license.

# Getting started 

Gribot is based on ROS (at the time being Lunar version).

To use Gribot software, you have to do the following:

1. Install a Ubuntu 16.04 server if not already done
2. Install ROS Lunar packages
3. Create a catking working folder
4. Clone gribot git folder

If everything went well, you should be able to start gribot in typing the following command:

```
roslaunch gribot gribot.launch
```
